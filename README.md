This project contains my solutions to the exercises of the class CS4400 "Deep Reinforcement Learning" at TU Delft.

The majority of the content in these notebooks were given as part of the project - I am principally responsible for the "core" of the implementation of the DRL algorithms.

We leave these here as they may be of relevance to, e.g., putative employers who examine this GitHub account - that said:

YOU MUST NOT USE THESE FOR YOUR CLASSWORK - I'D APPRECIATE IF YOU NOT EVEN LOOK AT THEM IN THAT CASE.

(If this becomes a problem, I will remove the repository upon request)

Please and thank you in advance.
